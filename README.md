# <div align="center">Java Quiz Program</div>

This repository contains a simple quiz program written in Java. The program issues a 10-question quiz to the student and then displays the percentage of questions answered correctly out of 10. It then resets so the quiz can be taken again. If a question is answered incorrectly, it keeps prompting until the student enters the correct answer, but the incorrect answer is not counted as correct. The program utilizes at least 3 programmer-defined methods in the class besides `main`.
